* React - used to make responsive pages that "react" in real time to changes on the pages.
* Semantic UI - Easy to use pre-built css framework that helps make building beautiful websites, easier.
* GraphQL - A query language that can be used on top of any backend. There are 3 types of graphQl operations that we can perform: queries (fetching data), mutations(writing data creating, updating and deleting) and then subscriptions that listen to changes in data in real time.

Graph ql is self -documenting
